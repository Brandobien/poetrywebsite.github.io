        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p1">The Samurai Dreams of Past Lovers</h1>
        <pre>
            Lying in a scarlet field 
            The samurai dreams of past lovers.
            
            On crushed flower buds 
            The glass counterpart reappears, 
            Like the white bed of peacetime 
            Disappearing in her palm 
            
            His blood mingles 
            With a hard spring rain,
            Tracing its last maze
            Back to the holy ocean
            
            His blood, which has lost its meaning, 
            Finds again its place amongst water,
            Carrying his dream of hands and eyes— 
            Disembodied— to alien shores 
            
            The silent moon shines,
            Casting shadows on the sea,
            Night embraces peace.

        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p2">Shitty Modern Art</h1>
        <pre> 
            I am semi human 
            The shadow in a gallery hallway 
            Whose walls are original 
            Blank 
            
            I am circular 
            My heart bound within 
            A handcuff of pages 
            Blank 
            
            I am an iron deer 
            In a room full of statues, 
            Barbarians are at the door 
            
            I am a mannequin 
            Dressed in rags
            Most of this disgusts me 
            Blank 
            
            I am 
            Blank 
            Triangle 
            Blank 
            Square 
            Blank canvas 
            Dipped in the ocean
            
            I am semi human
            The world washes over me 
            Like a painting made of snow
            
        </pre>
        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p3">Beneath the Fog</h1>
        <pre>
            Self cleaning bathrooms in the 
            San Francisco memory palace.
            Lost deeds, vagrant lovers roam the Tenderloin 
            Smoking Denim cigarettes 
            Using the robot toilet.
            
            A Man in a skeleton mask
            Vanishes over the fold of a hill.
            
            Crepuscular hotels  
            
            A boy working in a sub shop 
            A boy and a girl 
            Trapped in the reefs of their seaside university; 
            
            My presence is a whirlpool 
            Circling around nobody
            
            </pre>
        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p4">Driving to the Cookout with Uncle O.</h1>
        <pre>
            B:

            Tell me about the way it smelled. 
            
            The glowing steaks, 
            The midcentury sewer smoke, 
            
            Shot green and red by stoplights 
            Long since put to scrap
            
            O: 
            
            In those bulbs,
            The vision of cars snaking up a 
            Mountain pass at night
            
            A traffic jam on the highway, 
            O holy procession of tail lights!
            Drawn out like heart stains in a photograph
            
            B: 
            
            Like a dead man crawling to the river,
            Uncle Oedipus—I found you there. 
            
            Bivouacked with the others 
            Singing songs ‘round the campfire
            Grilling up a storm. 

            </pre>
        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p5">The Edge of the Graveyard</h1> 
        <pre>
            Somehow I became lost 
            Tracing the path I was always
            Meant to trace. I turned around, 
            And the forest was so much greener,
            The grass so much wilder 
            Then I remembered.
            
            The whole world is shaking, 
            As it is wont to do
            As if particles have visions too 
            As if together they are assembling 
            A vast and meaningless dream. And. 
            
            Nothing has the power to stop them 
            But this 

        </pre>
        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p6">My Embarcadero </h1>
        <pre>
            Multicolored lights on the tarmac 
            Strung out like Christmas trees 
            Or a weird arcade 
            Strung out like a junkie in this junkie town 
            —Like a madman.  
            
            The night shift is a Strange salamander existing, 
            A massive dark sky above every building—
            The tendrils of the corporate wasteland extending
            Across the country, 
            Subsuming it and rebirthing it stillborn. 
            
            Funny how I ended up here, 
            Totally unintended. 
            From the blocks of Brooklyn to the silicon highways of the bay— 
            The Spatial eradication of a temporal flight!
            There is nothing on the side of the road—but extension!   

        </pre>
        <h1 class="poem-title"id="p7">Shipwreck </h1>
        <pre>
            The current pulls me further out
            Past the last stretches of wispy island grass.
            My clothes get wet, 
            But the sea is a sanctuary where
            A man can be a boat unto the self

            With sails tattered yet pushing 
            Oars splintered and groaning 
            The raven, the gull, the grieving 
            Bird of Walt Whitman, 
            Rests where I float.
 
            For the sea is a sanctuary 
            The shore a collection 
            Of dead and dying things

            The sad galaxy of the inward facing shell,
            Scattered fragments of a viking conch,
            Bones dogs chewed or 
            Bones of dogs themselves,
            Shards of pottery, poetry, brick, stone, 

            Sand
            The sea is a shadow of a nonexistent 
            Hand 

        </pre>
        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p8">Minotaur</h1>
        <pre>
            I imagine the gun 
            The way it fires 
            The target 
            But not the person on the other end 
            
            A real action 
            That demands a suspension of morality. 
            An action 
            In which I step beyond myself 
            Like the man in The Stranger
            Who encounters a dummy in a volcanic landscape— 
            The stretch where the water melts the sand,
            The beach of glass 
            
            The antihero killing the nobody, 
            A non person committing a non action 
            And a body. 
            
            The consequence of blowing out the candle 
            Is darkness in a spot. 
            
            Although it is sunny outside and I love that love circulates the sidewalks—
            There is an aspect of destiny in a murder: 
            The victim’s fate. 
            
            I imagine the gun, 
            The trigger, the knife that sharpens itself 
            The tower, the elevator shaft that pisses into the abyss 
            The air running out, death in many forms, 
            The firefighters, the tunnels, and
            The men who make their homes in black passageways—

        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p9">Diffraction</h1>
        <pre>
            It’s splitting from the source!
            The light was a beam! 
            Now a series of lines. 
        
            Apart—
        
            Flies the atoms, from 
            The suns dying breath,
            Towards new stars, new 
        
            Starts—
        
            We go my towards, my 
            Friends. Apart!
            We go my friends. 
        
            "Tell me your De Broglie wavelength, 
            I’ll tell you mine. 
        
            Matter behaves like waves and I must 
            Know how to find you
            Before we diffract"

        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p10">I Saw My Sweetie Pie on a Bus</h1>
        <pre>
            She told me this isn’t enough,
            Then receded beyond the 
            Electric draped poles.

            On another day I chase it  
            But today, I went running,
            And now, I’m too tired. 

        </pre>
        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p11">Suspension</h1>
        <pre>
            My schizophrenic sister out there in the deep blue,
            We watch baseball 

            In an apartment building. 
            A satellite city
            A hunchback diner on the corner 
            Kneels amongst skyscrapers.

            Look across the way 
            Empty air, empty office spaces 
            My parents, 
            Captive in a tower 
            Afraid. 

            Their ears don’t work 
            They drift in and out of a reverie

        </pre>
        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p12">The Wildfire Blues</h1>
        <pre>
            Everything went so fast 
            Like a steam train hurtling off a bridge. 
            In The Prado paintings are melting, 
            Cabins, romantic landscapes, 
            Sliding down the bank
            Away to the muddy river 
            The bloody river 
            The black wellspring 

            As the landscape grew more hellish 
            The window was enveloped in smoke. 
            Outside the shelter the fire was 
            Big Big Big-

            Shackled to a cursed hand
            The gift that keeps on giving

        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p13">At Some Point I was a Chinaman</h1>
        <pre>
            I’ve glimpsed true life 
            It echoes through me 
            like a spirit departing 
            from an ancient vase, 
            
            And like a bird of jade 
            yet to be chiseled, one day 
            I will shelter stars 
            in my wings

        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p14">Logistics of Leaving</h1>
        <pre>
            My backpack is my hamper again. 
            Regret and sadness scatter throughout 
            The last days. 
            
            There is excitement 
            But it is a ghost who 
            Speaks in makeshift tongues 
            and garbled places:
            
            The projection of derelict hotels, 
            Sun blasted parking lots, 
            Blue compartments of the unending train. 
            
            I think of these things, 
            How they sink below the steps 
            I am taking now, 
            
            Dropped haphazardly 
            Like a mango tree drops 
            Ripe fruits to the ground.

        <pre>
            Purple flowers frame by frame beyond the window
            I don’t think, I just hold on 

            To paradise 

            Unweaving in the heart. 

            The fatal glow of a fuel truck on faraway tarmac
            Sick mentally and physically 
            Random upgrades to first class 
            Random bomb checks at the gate 

            A plane is only a flying tube, 
            A test tube exploding in the
            hands of a mad scientist—

            I am not going home 
            I’m just going 

            I’ve told her many things, 
            the truest being

            ‘I love you’ 
            ‘Don’t stop running’

        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p16">Eventually I Break</h1>
        <pre>
            You like the sails of western Manhattan 
            Like the moon descending over Newark
            Like the last sun on the end of a Jersey platform, 
            Waiting for a train 
        
            You who I would go through infinite farewells for
            Or walk home again and again 
            Through the empty streets of Brooklyn by night.
            You who I would get on my knees for—
            Why must you drift always out of sight. 
        
            You who I love
            —Eventually I break—
        
            Care is a hard thing to take,
            Into the tunnels of this relentless life  
        
            That like a subway traces the same vein endlessly 
            On tracks that resonate a discreet and ominous song. 
        
            Eventually I succumb to the mystery: 
        
            By and by, who will hold me when I’m gone?

        <h1 class="poem-title" id="p17">Today Amongst the Dead</h1>
        <pre>
            The sun comes into the room
            but it is too windy 
            to go to the cemetery 

            So I lay with a book 
            amongst the soft folds of the bed
